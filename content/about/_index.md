I'm a product-focused software engineer with a strong interest in building and testing great products from an engineering perspective.

Currently, I'm working at [Grapevine](https://www.grapevine.in/home), where we're building a social media platform tailored for working professionals. I'm part of the team developing our newest product, Round 1 AI, an interview preparation tool designed to help candidates practice and land jobs at top companies.

Previously, I worked at [Tortoise](https://tortoise.pro/), a product-based startup with a compact team of 8, including 4 engineers. I collaborated closely with the founding team to build products across multiple platforms — including web dashboards, a React Native app, and custom payment flows for WhatsApp. Like many startups, we experimented across various markets, including building our own SaaS-based wallet system. During my time there, we launched and iterated on several products, including our latest, Proconut.

Before Tortoise, I started my professional journey as a freelance developer during college, working independently for 3 years. I then joined Neoito, a service-based company, as an Associate Software Engineer, where I honed my skills working on client-facing projects.

Through all of these experiences, my goal has been to understand what it takes to build meaningful, user-centric products — and to share the knowledge I gain along the way.
