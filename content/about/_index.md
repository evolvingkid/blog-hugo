I'm a passionate engineer. In the beginning, I was into the flutter framework but then I realized that sticking with a framework is not a good thing. If you are a developer or an engineer then you must always need to do any kind of development process. 

You must know how things work and try to improve those processes.

So from this blog, I am trying to share knowledge that I gain.
